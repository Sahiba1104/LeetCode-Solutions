# ⚙️ Prerequisites – Learn These First

Before starting with DSA problem sets (Easy → Medium → Hard), make sure you have a strong grasp of these **fundamental concepts**.  
They are used repeatedly in almost every **array, string, and subarray**-based question.

## 🧠 1️⃣ Array Traversal  
**Concept:** Iterate through arrays forward and backward to process or modify elements.  

**Example:**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    // Forward traversal
}

for (int i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    // Backward traversal
}
